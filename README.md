# TBDataPreparation
**Repository for the code to convert raw test-beam data to ROOT ntuples.**

## Setup
```
mkdir My_Workspace
cd My_Workspace
git clone https://github.com/DRCalo/TBDataPreparation.git
TBDataPreparation/init.sh
source setup.sh  # this needs to be called each time one starts with new shell
```
Then, add or modify Env variables in the generated `setup.sh` to run samples in a easy way.

## Available test beam data sets
This is the list of processed data from the 2023 CERN SPS-H8 test-beam. We produce the corresponding new data for each new version of the code. The data processing is centralized, for further data requests contact Lorenzo Pezzotti and Iacopo Vivarelli.
